# photoAppRESTAPI

Hi, Thanks for checking out my project!

This is the API for my Photo Sharing App (https://github.com/wannasplitapineapple/iosLocalPhotoSharingApp). 
I made it using Django Rest Framework and python. It serializes, and deserializes data going from my app to the database and back, handling everything from users, photos, comments, upvotes, and downvotes. 

I had alot of fun and learned a whole lot making this project so far and have alot of plans for the future as well...

Thanks for taking a look!
